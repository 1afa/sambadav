- No longer fail to login a user when the userhome LDAP attribute is not found,
  but steam on without setting a user dir. (Less fragile/surprising behaviour.)

- Incorporate LDAP-based home directories;
- Add logo image to file listing;
- Add logo images;
- Move LDAP auth logic into separate class;
- Place Propflags, Directory and File classes in proper \SambaDAV\ namespace;
- Simplify the way in which a Node finds its parent (parent passes a reference
  to itself in getChild() instead of a lookup based on the parent's path).
- Add Propflags class: split off the logic surrounding file/dir flags into a
  separate class. Makes sense since the logic is the same for files and
  directories. Also provides a better location for win32 propstring de/encoding
  than common.inc.php.
- Add SMBCLIENT_EXTRA_OPTS config variable, to pass extra options to smbclient;
- SMBFile::updateProperties(): update flags on files by calling the `setmode`
  command of smbclient. Add a decoder function for the Win32 property string,
  because Win32 passes its file flags in that form. Unfortunately, files appear
  to only support setting the Hidden flag, and flags on directories cannot be
  set at all.
- Config files: change remaining references to the old internal 'Webfolders'
  name to the new name for the open-source project, 'SambaDAV'.

* Wed Jul 24 2013 Alfred Klomp <alfred@bokxing-it.nl> v0.1
- Adapt the `webfolders` internal project into a standalone project called
  SambaDAV, to be open-sourced and hosted on GitHub.
