- Add pattern engine for userhome, LDAP and Samba usernames/domains;

* Mon Sep 22 2014 Alfred Klomp <alfred@1afa.com> v0.4.1
- Fix LDAP escaping bug, and use of undefined variable;
- Don't include test suite in release tarballs;

* Tue Sep 09 2014 Alfred Klomp <alfred@1afa.com> v0.4.0
- README.md: update with information about the new config system.
- Config system: replace old globals-based config system with a system
  based on supplying array keys;
- LDAP: add options to choose between AD bind and simple bind mechanisms;

* Mon Aug 11 2014 Alfred Klomp <alfred@1afa.com> v0.3.1
- Travis CI: add jobfile for automated testing;
- Cache: add unit tests;
- Cache: no longer static, and split in base class and implementors;
- Directory: fix typo in logging code;
- Cache: password also contributes to cache file name;
- Auth: make this class the maintainer of the 'is anonymous' flag;

* Wed Aug 06 2014 Alfred Klomp <alfred@1afa.com> v0.3.0
- Auth: add this class to provide centralized auth handling;
- Config: load all PHP files from config dir, not just the "well known" ones;
- Implement getLastModified for directories;
- Deleting nonempty folders now works; first delete children recursively;
- smbclient: honor the 'N' flag when encountered for NORMAL files;
- Show actual server and share in title of Browser plugin, not webserver path;
- Use new URI class for handling URI's, remove manual string manipulations;
- Move all of SambaDAV to a PSR-0 compliant dir structure;
- Implement own Browser plugin; remove patch dir;
- MD5 streamfilter: place in own class, avoid global variable;
- Login form: generate from template file in its own class;
- Use Composer to install SabreDAV and other dependencies;
- Rework all global logging functions into a static Log class;
- Rework all loose smb_ functions into a static SMB class;
- Put all cache functions into static class;
- Factor smbclient output parser into its own class;
- Change FALSE() and FALSE to comparisons with 'false', which is more standard.

* Thu Nov 07 2013 Alfred Klomp <alfred@bokxing-it.nl> v0.2.1
- Print a simple login form when basic authentication fails; this login form
  uses JavaScript to load the credentials into the browser's authentication
  cache, thereby hopefully keeping the user logged in.
- Add spinner animation for later use;
- No longer fail to login a user when the userhome LDAP attribute is not found,
  but steam on without setting a user dir. (Less fragile/surprising behaviour.)

* Thu Oct 17 2013 Alfred Klomp <alfred@bokxing-it.nl> v0.2
- Incorporate LDAP-based home directories;
- Add logo image to file listing;
- Add logo images;
- Move LDAP auth logic into separate class;
- Place Propflags, Directory and File classes in proper \SambaDAV\ namespace;
- Simplify the way in which a Node finds its parent (parent passes a reference
  to itself in getChild() instead of a lookup based on the parent's path).
- Add Propflags class: split off the logic surrounding file/dir flags into a
  separate class. Makes sense since the logic is the same for files and
  directories. Also provides a better location for win32 propstring de/encoding
  than common.inc.php.
- Add SMBCLIENT_EXTRA_OPTS config variable, to pass extra options to smbclient;
- SMBFile::updateProperties(): update flags on files by calling the `setmode`
  command of smbclient. Add a decoder function for the Win32 property string,
  because Win32 passes its file flags in that form. Unfortunately, files appear
  to only support setting the Hidden flag, and flags on directories cannot be
  set at all.
- Config files: change remaining references to the old internal 'Webfolders'
  name to the new name for the open-source project, 'SambaDAV'.

* Wed Jul 24 2013 Alfred Klomp <alfred@bokxing-it.nl> v0.1
- Adapt the `webfolders` internal project into a standalone project called
  SambaDAV, to be open-sourced and hosted on GitHub.
