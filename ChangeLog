- SMBFile::updateProperties(): update flags on files by calling the `setmode`
  command of smbclient. Add a decoder function for the Win32 property string,
  because Win32 passes its file flags in that form. Unfortunately, files appear
  to only support setting the Hidden flag, and flags on directories cannot be
  set at all.
- Config files: change remaining references to the old internal 'Webfolders'
  name to the new name for the open-source project, 'SambaDAV'.

- Adapt the `webfolders` internal project into a standalone project called
  SambaDAV, to be open-sourced and hosted on GitHub.
